This functions uses the f_oneway function from the stats library to 
perform a one-way ANOVA analysis on three datasets.

Inputs:
- Three datasets (list or numpy arrays)

Outputs:
- The calculated f-statistic
- The p-value indicating the probability of observing 
  the data if the null hypothesis is true.
- Statement interpreting the p-value
